```{r}
#Chunk one, let's use this for basic EDA, initial understanding of the dataset
housing_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/shime/Downloads/zhvi-all-homes_md-va-dc_2021-2023.csv")
str(data)
summary(data)

```
Our dataset has `r nrow(housing_data)` observations
We've also observed 9 variables, but likely won't be using all of them. 
We have null values for ZHVI

```{r}
#Chunk two, breakdown/filtering of data by state

dc_data <- subset(housing_data, State == "DC")
md_data <- subset(housing_data, State == "MD")
va_data <- subset(housing_data, State == "VA")

mean_dc <- mean(dc_data$ZHVI)

```
Maryland and Virginia are the only of the three that has NA's with a total of 468 NAs'and 1028 NA's



```{r} 
#Chunk three, further breakdown 


```
